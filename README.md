## About the Workshop
Welcome to this private, hands-on workshop led by MathWorks experts. Throughout this session, youâ€™ll engage in a series of interactive online exercises designed to help you design, prototype, and test your own phased array systems. Key concepts such as beamforming, steering, and nulling will be covered in depth. By the end of the workshop, you will be equipped with practical skills and a deeper understanding of phased array design, ready to apply these techniques to your own projects.

## Agenda
